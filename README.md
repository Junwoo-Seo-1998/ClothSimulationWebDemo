# Description
I developed a Cloth Physics Simulation using JavaScript, implementing the Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD) method. XPBD is a powerful technique that allows for stable and realistic simulation of cloth by iteratively solving constraints while maintaining the physical plausibility of the cloth material. The simulation involved handling various constraints such as distance constraints for maintaining the structural integrity of the cloth, as well as bending constraints to simulate the cloth’s flexibility.
